#### Process and Some Thoughts:
I think that this is the easiest project until now, the display part was the most difficult (it has some know issues). I think that I will be revisiting this project in the future to correct some errors and add some features (maybe percentage, power, root, and full integrity negative numbers) but for now I think it's okay.

I really enjoyed this project, very linear, no big trouble.

#### Known Issues:   
- If the number is too long it breaks through the display                
- Lets you divide by 0 and returns "infinity" insted of undefined (maybe add a pop up?)
- If you start to input after a result was thrown you can change the result string (example: if you do 2+2 and returns 4, and then you type 36 you have 436)
- Need to restart currentNum after throwing a result if no operation button is pressed
                
- Need to add some accesibility:
  - A lower display may be useful to know what are you doing
  - Color changes
  - Dark reader compatibility
